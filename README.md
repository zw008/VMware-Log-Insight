Read-only log search and aggregation for **VMware Aria Operations for Logs**
(formerly vRealize Log Insight) — the appliance that collects syslog from ESXi
hosts, vCenter, and VMs. The centralized-log data source for the VMware skill
family. **Strictly non-destructive**: it queries, it never writes.

## Companion Skills

| Need | Skill | Tools |
|---|---|:-:|
| Raw centralized logs + spikes | **vmware-log-insight** (this) | 7 |
| vCenter events & alarms | [vmware-monitor](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Monitor) | 27 |
| Metrics, anomalies, capacity | [vmware-aria](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Aria) | 28 |
| Incident correlation / root cause | [vmware-debug](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Debug) — feed it `log_search` output | 2 |
| VM lifecycle / operations | [vmware-aiops](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops) | 49 |

## Install

```bash
uv tool install vmware-log-insight
mkdir -p ~/.vmware-log-insight
cp config.example.yaml ~/.vmware-log-insight/config.yaml   # edit host/username/provider
echo 'VMWARE_LOG_INSIGHT_PROD_PASSWORD=...' > ~/.vmware-log-insight/.env
chmod 600 ~/.vmware-log-insight/.env
vmware-log-insight doctor
```

### Offline / Air-Gapped Install (from source)

This project uses the modern PEP 517 build system (hatchling), so there is **no
`setup.py`** by design — that is expected, not a missing file. If you cloned the
source and hit `ERROR: File "setup.py" or "setup.cfg" not found ... editable mode
currently requires a setuptools-based build`, your `pip` is older than 21.3 and
cannot do an *editable* (`-e`) install with a non-setuptools backend. Editable
mode is a developer convenience, not needed to run the tool — do one of:

```bash
# From the source tree — a normal (non-editable) install builds a wheel:
pip install .              # NOT  pip install -e .

# ...or upgrade pip first, and editable works too:
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -e .
```

For a **truly air-gapped host**, build the wheels on a connected machine and copy
them over — the target then needs no network:

```bash
# On a connected machine, collect this package + its dependencies as wheels:
pip wheel . -w dist        # → dist/*.whl   (or: uv build, for just this package)

# Copy dist/ to the air-gapped host, then install offline:
pip install --no-index --find-links dist vmware-log-insight
```

## MCP Tools (7 — all read-only)

| Tool | What |
|---|---|
| `log_search` | Search events by time window + text + filters |
| `log_aggregate` | Count/aggregate over time bins, with z-score spike detection |
| `log_fields` | List extracted fields usable in filters |
| `log_version` | Appliance version/build |
| `alert_list` / `alert_get` / `alert_history` | Query defined alerts and their trigger history |

## Workflows

- **Find errors fast** — `vmware-log-insight search -q error -l 1h`.
- **Where did logs burst?** — `vmware-log-insight aggregate -q error -l 6h --bin-ms 300000`, read `spikes[]`, then `search` the spike window.
- **Root cause** — pass `log_search` results (plus vCenter events from vmware-monitor and metrics from vmware-aria) to **vmware-debug** `incident_timeline`.

## Troubleshooting

- `401 on /sessions` → check username/password/`provider` and the `VMWARE_LOG_INSIGHT_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` env var.
- `503 everywhere` → appliance starting up; `doctor` reports it as a status, not a crash.
- Empty results → widen `--last`; default API port is **9543** (set `port` if different).

## Security

Read-only by construction. Credentials in `~/.vmware-log-insight/.env` (`chmod 600`);
plaintext passwords auto-obfuscated to grep-safe `b64:` (obfuscation, not
encryption — inject from a secret manager for real secrecy). TLS on by default.
