"""Shared MCP plumbing for the vmware-log-insight tool modules.

Tool functions live in ``vmware_log_insight/mcp_server/tools/*.py`` and register onto the
single
``mcp`` instance defined here. This module imports nothing from the tool
packages (tools import *from* ``_shared``, never the reverse) to avoid a circular
import. ``vmware_log_insight/mcp_server/server.py`` re-exports these so the historical
import paths
keep resolving.

    """Return an agent-safe error string; log full detail server-side only.

    LogInsightApiError (the connection layer's teaching errors) and intentional
    validation errors pass through; anything else is masked so raw response
    bodies / host:port pairs never reach the agent.

    ``ConfigError`` is on the list because ``config.get_password`` raises it to
    report a missing ``VMWARE_LOG_INSIGHT_<TARGET>_PASSWORD``, naming the
    variable to set. Every tool reaches that path through ``_get_connection``,
    so leaving it off turned the most common first-run failure in this skill
    into ``operation failed.`` — the one message where the remedy *is* the text.

    It is deliberately narrower than the ``OSError`` it subclasses. Allowing the
    base class through admitted every other OS-level failure with it, and
    ``sanitize()`` strips control characters and truncates — it redacts nothing.
    ``socket.gaierror`` quotes the name that failed to resolve; this package
    authored none of that text. The FileNotFoundError / PermissionError /
    ConnectionError entries stay: they are narrower still and record the
    specific subclasses this package raises on purpose.

    Swapping the entry is necessary but not sufficient, which is why the
    ``ssl.SSLError`` reduction sits *ahead* of the allowlist rather than in it:
    ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` inherits from ``ValueError`` as well as
    ``OSError``, and ``ValueError`` predates all of this. An allowlist cannot
    express "not this one", so the exclusion has to be checked first. Only
    ``ssl.SSLError`` — ``socket.gaierror`` and ``ConnectionRefusedError`` have
    ``OSError`` as their only base and are already reduced, so naming them here
    would make this guard sound broader than it is.

    Measured reach, so nobody has to guess: on this skill's own transport it
    never fires. httpx maps a certificate failure to ``httpx.ConnectError``,
    which is not an ``ssl.SSLError`` and not on the allowlist either, and
    ``connection.py`` translates it into an authored ``LogInsightApiError``
    before it gets here. The guard covers a raw TLS error arriving by some other
    route; the leak that actually happened was ``connection.py`` interpolating
    that exception's text into a message the allowlist passes through.

    ``RuntimeError`` is deliberately absent. It is Python's generic catch-all,
    so allowing it through would pass any library's raw text as if this package
    had authored it.
