"""Log Insight (Aria Operations for Logs) REST client with session auth.

Authenticates via ``POST /api/v2/sessions`` with username/password/provider and
carries the returned ``sessionId`` as ``Authorization: Bearer <sessionId>`` on
subsequent calls. The session has a TTL (seconds); it is re-acquired
automatically near expiry.

Per CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #37, HTTP error codes are translated to a teaching
``LogInsightApiError`` in ONE place (``_request``), so callers never surface a
raw httpx traceback: transient gateway errors (502/503/504) and transport
failures get one light retry, a 401 triggers a single re-auth, and 4xx client
errors (e.g. 404 for a bad alert id) are not retried.

Base URL pattern: https://<host>:<port>/api/v2  (default port 9543)
