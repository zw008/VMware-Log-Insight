"""The skill's most common first-run failure reached the agent as a class name.

``_safe_error`` reduces unrecognised exceptions to ``"<Class>: operation
failed."`` so raw Log Insight response bodies and host:port pairs cannot leak.
Its allowlist was assembled from the exception types the *tool* layer raises —
``LogInsightApiError`` and the validation errors — and stopped there.

``config.get_password`` raises a bare ``OSError`` naming the environment
variable to set, and every tool in this skill reaches it: ``_get_connection`` →
``ConnectionManager.connect`` → ``get_password``. So the first thing a new
operator hits, before a single query runs, was::

    OSError: operation failed.

instead of ``Set environment variable: VMWARE_LOG_INSIGHT_PROD_PASSWORD``.

That is the case where the message *is* the remedy — there is nothing else to
work from, no hint that names the variable, and the variable is per-target so it
cannot be guessed. Nothing caught it because the CLI path prints the exception
in full and the connection tests assert on the raise site, never on what the MCP
wrapper leaves of it.

``RuntimeError`` is not on the list and must not be added. It is the generic
catch-all: allowing it would pass any library's raw text through as though this
package had authored it, which is the leak the wrapper exists to stop.

The first repair of that defect overshot: it admitted bare ``OSError``, and
``sanitize()`` only strips control characters and truncates — it redacts
nothing, so every other OS-level failure came through with it. The passthrough
is now the narrow ``ConfigError`` that ``config.py`` actually raises, and TLS
errors are reduced *before* the allowlist is consulted, because
``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` also inherits from ``ValueError`` and an
allowlist cannot express "not this one".
