"""Official Aria Operations for Logs (vRealize Log Insight) REST API index.

Source of truth for spec-conformance tests (CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #36: API layers must
be validated against the official spec, never written from model memory).

Provenance (fetched 2026-06-23):
  - Broadcom developer portal — vRealize Log Insight API:
    https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/vrealize-log-insight-api/latest/
  - Community API docs (v1, comprehensive): https://vmw-loginsight.github.io/
  - Broadcom TechDocs 8.18 "The vRealize Log Insight REST API":
    https://techdocs.broadcom.com/.../the-vrealize-log-insight-rest-api.html

Notes:
  - Base URL: https://<host>:9543/api/v2 (public API). Default port 9543, JSON.
  - Auth: POST /api/v2/sessions {username, password, provider} -> {sessionId, ttl}.
    Subsequent calls send  Authorization: Bearer <sessionId>.
  - Query constraint syntax is encoded in the URL path as /field/OPERATOR/value
    segments (operators: CONTAINS, =, !=, <, >, LAST <ms> for time windows).
  - v2 is the current line; v1 paths remain documented and are kept here so the
    spec test recognises both. Exact v2 response schemas can only be confirmed
    against a live instance's /rest-api reference — tracked in BACKLOG (same
    "needs real-hardware verification" status as VKS /wcp/login).

Each entry: (METHOD, PATH_TEMPLATE). Path params are written as {name}.
