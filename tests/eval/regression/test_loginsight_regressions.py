    ``@vmware_tool`` marks a call failed when an exception reaches it, or when

    truthy ``error``. All seven tools in this skill catch and return exactly
    that envelope, so no explicit ``report_tool_failure`` call is needed here.

    That is a property of this surface, not a guarantee, which is why it is
    pinned: a tool rewritten to hand back an error *string* would look identical
    to a success, and the audit row would say ``ok`` for an operation that
