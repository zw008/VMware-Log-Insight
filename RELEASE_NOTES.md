## v1.8.2 (2026-07-20) — the MCP server moves into the package namespace

### Fixed — co-installing two skills broke all but the last one

Every skill shipped its MCP server as a **top-level `mcp_server` package**. Python
has one top-level namespace, so installing any two of them into one environment let
the second overwrite the first — silently, with no error and no warning.

    uv tool install vmware-aiops   ->  49 tools   (correct)
    uv pip  install vmware-aiops   ->  27 tools   (Monitor's read-only server)

vmware-aiops depends on vmware-monitor, so this was not an edge case: **every pip
install hit it**, and the operator got 27 read-only tools where 49 were expected,
with all 35 write tools missing. Docker images, shared MCP hosts and CI runners that
install more than one skill were affected the same way.

The server now lives at `vmware_<skill>/mcp_server/`, a name only this package can
claim. Introduced 2026-02-26; it survived 70 releases because every test ran against
a single package in its own repo, where the local directory shadows site-packages —
the conflict was invisible by construction.

**Migration.** Console scripts are unchanged: `vmware-<skill>` and
`vmware-<skill>-mcp` work exactly as before, as does `"command": "vmware-<skill>",
"args": ["mcp"]` in an MCP client config. Only a direct `python -m mcp_server`
breaks; use `python -m vmware_<skill>.mcp_server`.

### Added — `references/agent-guardrails.md` in every skill

The operating rules for local and small models (Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen, Mistral via
Goose / Ollama / OpenShift AI) existed in two skills. They now ship in all 13, each
with its own tool counts and failure modes, and are linked from every SKILL.md.

### Changed — Python floor is 3.10 across the family

vmware-debug and vmware-log-insight demanded 3.11 on the grounds that FastMCP schema
reflection was unreliable on 3.10. That was the symptom of PEP 604 `X | None` in the
server's own signatures, fixed in 1.8.0. 3.10 was verified end to end on 2026-07-19 —
every tool's schema built, zero failures — so the stricter floor was rejecting a
version that works.

## v1.8.1 (2026-07-19) — read-only mode reaches the surfaces that teach it

v1.8.0 put read-only mode in the code and documented it in the README only.
Every other layer was empty, and each serves a different reader: SKILL.md is what
the agent loads, setup-guide is what an operator reads while configuring, `doctor`
is where they verify it took. The gap had two concrete costs.

An agent read SKILL.md, called a write tool the gate had withheld, and got nothing
back — with no way to learn that the absence was a deliberate lockdown rather than
a fault. It reads as a broken tool, so the model retries or hunts for a workaround.

An operator who set the switch had no way to confirm it. The only signal was a line
in the MCP server's start-up log.

### Added — the feature is now documented where each reader looks

- **SKILL.md** — a short section telling the agent that a missing write tool is a
  lockdown, not a fault: name the blocked operation, do not retry, do not route
  around it.
- **references/setup-guide.md** — the operator's view: how to enable it, the
  precedence chain, and how to verify.
- **references/capabilities.md** — which tools the gate withholds.

### Added — `doctor` reports the read-only state

`vmware-log-insight doctor` now shows whether read-only mode is on, **which** of the three
switches decided it, and the value as written. A typo'd value (`ture`) is called
out as a typo rather than reported as a confident ON — it resolves to on, which is
fail-closed but almost never what was meant.

The resolution runs through `vmware_policy.read_only_status()` rather than a local
copy of the precedence chain: a doctor that disagrees with the gate it reports on is
worse than no doctor. Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.1`.

## v1.8.0 (2026-07-18) — read-only mode, working policy defaults, declared environments

Family release driven by [VMware-AIops#31](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/issues/31),
where an operator running Llama 3.3 70B (Goose / OpenShift AI, on-prem H100) had to
hand-write 17 prompt guardrails to make tool calling reliable. A prompt is advisory — a
model can ignore it. Every guardrail that could move into the harness has.

### Added
- **Read-only mode.** Set `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` (or `VMWARE_<SKILL>_READ_ONLY`, or
  `read_only: true` in config.yaml) and every write tool is removed from the MCP registry
  at start-up. `list_tools()` never offers them, so the model cannot call what it cannot
  see. **Off by default** — nothing changes unless you turn it on. Fail-closed: if the
  mode is requested but cannot be guaranteed, the server refuses to start rather than
  running open.
- **`environment:` on each config target**, declaring which environment it is
  (production / staging / lab). Policy rules scope by this value.

### Added — list results now state whether they are complete

Every `[READ]` list tool returns the family envelope instead of a bare array:

    {"items": [...], "returned": 50, "limit": 50, "total": 213,
     "truncated": true, "hint": "Showing 50 of 213. Raise limit or narrow the query..."}

This closes the reported failure where long responses were summarised as "no data
returned": a bare list gives a model no way to tell a complete answer from page one, so
it guessed. `truncated: false` now positively states completeness — including when
`items` is empty, which means "checked, found none", not "the call failed".

- **3 tool(s) converted** across ops, MCP and CLI. Real totals at no extra cost: the appliance returns each collection in one GET and the
  limit was applied client-side, so the match count was already in memory. `alert_list`
  counts matches, respecting `name_filter`.

### Changed — migration, read this
- **Approval tiers now actually run.** They shipped in v1.6.0 but the engine only ever
  read `~/.vmware/rules.yaml`, and a fresh install has no such file — so every deny rule,
  maintenance window and approval tier had been inert on every install that never
  hand-authored one. A packaged baseline now loads when you have written no rules of your
  own. Writes at medium risk and above are stamped with their tier in the audit log;
  irreversible work and guest execution against a target declared `production` require a
  named approver via `VMWARE_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`.
- **`environment:` will become required for writes.** Today a state-changing operation
  against a target that declares none still runs and logs a warning. **The next major
  release refuses it.** Declare it now and that upgrade is a no-op:

      targets:
        prod-vc01:
          host: vc01.corp.local
          environment: production

  Read-only operations are never affected, in this release or the next. Check what applies
  to your targets before upgrading: `vmware-audit policy --operation vm_delete --env <env>`.

### Fixed
- **Policy glob patterns with a leading wildcard silently matched nothing.** A rule written
  `operations: ["*_delete"]` parsed fine, read correctly, and never fired — only a trailing
  `*` was honoured. Now full glob matching, for operations and environments alike.
- Config-path overrides (`VMWARE_<SKILL>_CONFIG`) are honoured when reading `read_only`
  and `environment`, so a setting in a custom config file is no longer silently ignored.

### Notes
- Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.0`; publish that package first.
- `vmware-audit policy` reports which rules are in force and where they came from —
  including the case where your rules file exists but failed to parse, which previously
  looked identical to "policy is working".

## v1.6.1 (2026-06-24) — initial release

First release of **vmware-log-insight**: read-only log search and aggregation for
VMware Aria Operations for Logs (vRealize Log Insight). The centralized-log data
source for the VMware skill family.

### Added
- **7 read-only MCP tools**: `log_search` (time-window + text + filter event
  search), `log_aggregate` (COUNT/UCOUNT/AVG/… time series with z-score spike
  detection), `log_fields`, `log_version`, `alert_list`, `alert_get`,
  `alert_history`.
- **Typer CLI** mirroring the tools: `search`, `aggregate`, `fields`,
  `alert list/get/history`, `doctor`, `mcp`, `version`.
- **Session auth** (`POST /api/v2/sessions`, Bearer token, TTL refresh) with
  **centralized HTTP error translation** to teaching `LogInsightApiError`
  (status + path + fix hint); transient 502/503/504 + transport errors retry once,
  401 re-auths once, 4xx are not retried (CLAUDE.md 错误恢复三层 / 踩坑 #37).
- **Path-encoded constraint builder** with human duration shorthand ("1h", "30m",
  "7d") and URL-escaped values; never issues an unbounded query (defaults to last hour).
- **`.env` password obfuscation** built in from day one: plaintext `*_PASSWORD`
  auto-rewritten to grep-safe `b64:` via python-dotenv's own parser (obfuscation,
  not encryption; secret-manager injection documented). CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #38.
- **Spec-conformance test** (踩坑 #36): AST-scans every HTTP call against the
  official API index in `tests/eval/spec/` so a hallucinated endpoint fails CI.
- Regression evals: MCP tool exposure (踩坑 #34), read-only invariant, b64 parity.

### Notes
- Strictly **read-only** — no ingest/write tools.
- Exact v2 response schemas are parsed defensively across documented wire variants;
  confirmation against a live appliance's `/rest-api` reference is tracked in BACKLOG
  (same real-hardware-verification status as VKS `/wcp/login`).
