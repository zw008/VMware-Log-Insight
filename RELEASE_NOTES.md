## v1.8.4 (2026-07-20) — errors that teach, and tool descriptions a small model can route from

A capability eval was rolled out across the family and asked two open questions:
when a call fails, is the model told enough to fix it, and can it pick the right
tool from the description alone? Both answers were worse than anyone thought, and
in several places the reason was that the measurement was looking somewhere other
than where the model reads.

### Fixed — teaching messages were being discarded on the way to the agent

`_safe_error` reduces unrecognised exceptions to `"<Class>: operation failed."`
so raw API text, credentials in URLs and internal paths cannot reach an agent.
Its allowlist held only the builtin validation errors — so this skill's **own**
domain exceptions, the ones that exist precisely to carry a corrected next step,
had their messages replaced by their class names.

The effect was invisible from the CLI, which prints those messages in full.

The worst case was shared by nine skills: `config.py` raises exactly one
`OSError`, the missing-password error, whose entire remedy is the environment
variable name it names. An agent hitting an unconfigured target received
`OSError: operation failed.` and had nothing to act on. That is the family's most
common first-run failure, and it landed one release after the documented variable
names were corrected — so the message that would have unstuck the operator was
the one being thrown away.

The rule is now the property it always meant: **every exception this skill raises
on purpose passes through**, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced.
`RuntimeError` stays reduced — it is the generic catch-all and in several skills
carries raw upstream text.

### Fixed — error messages now carry the correction

Every message that reported a failure without saying how to recover was
rewritten: it names the offending value, gives an imperative remedy, and names
something concrete to act on — a tool that exists, a real CLI command, a config
file, an environment variable. Recovery becomes an instruction-following problem
rather than an inference one, which is what a weak model can still do.

Three classes of defect surfaced while doing it:

- **Remedies that were never delivered.** `_safe_error` truncates with no
  ellipsis, so a message longer than the cap loses its closing sentence
  silently. One message had been shipping at 396 characters against a 300-char
  cap — its remedy had never once reached an agent. Messages now lead with the
  remedy so a long interpolated value truncates the expendable detail instead.
- **Commands that do not exist.** One skill's error hints named a `doctor`
  subcommand it does not have.
- **Tools that do not exist.** A tool description pointed at two sibling-skill
  tools that had been renamed, and another named a tool that had moved to a
  different skill entirely.

### Improved — tool descriptions state when to use them and what to call next

The description is the API for a small model: an unstated routing rule is a
routing rule that does not exist, and a tool with no stated next hop is one the
model stops at. Descriptions now say when to prefer this tool over a sibling,
what shape comes back, the caveat that bites, and which tool to call after.

**Manifest size did not grow.** Descriptions load into every session, so the
routing clauses were paid for by cutting duplicated reference material —
repeated boilerplate, examples that restated the parameter list, and prose
copies of the pagination contract.

### Note

Every tool and CLI command named anywhere in this release was verified against
the live MCP registry and the live command tree, not against documentation.

## v1.8.3 (2026-07-20) — credentials resolve as a pair; documented env vars now exist

### Added — the per-target username can come from the environment

Adapted from [VMware-AIops#33](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/pull/33) by
@wright-bench, with thanks. The password already resolved from an env var; the
username did not, so a deployment injecting credentials from a secret store
(systemd `EnvironmentFile`, container secrets, a vault sidecar) could externalise
only half of the pair — and a config-file username paired with an env password
from a different account logs in as nobody.

`<PASSWORD-KEY-PREFIX>_USERNAME` now overrides the `username:` in config.yaml,
using that skill's own password-key convention. Absent, config.yaml still wins;
nothing changes for anyone not setting it.

**Resolved on every access, like the password.** The contributed version read the
username once at load time while the password stayed a property, which
reintroduces exactly the split the override exists to prevent: a sidecar rotating
both halves mid-process moves the password and leaves the username behind. A test
pins that both halves resolve at the same moment.

### Fixed — documented credential variables that the code never read

Rolling the above across the family surfaced a separate defect: four skills
documented a password variable their own loader does not look up. An operator
following the documentation exactly — correct file, correct place, correct-looking
name — got "Password not found".

| Skill | Documented | Actually read |
|---|---|---|
| vmware-nsx | `VMWARE_NSX_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` for target `nsx-prod` → `VMWARE_NSX_PROD_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_NSX_NSX_PROD_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-nsx-security | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_NSX_SECURITY_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-aria | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_ARIA_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-vks | `VMWARE_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` | `VMWARE_VKS_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` |
| vmware-avi | three different forms across three files | `<CONTROLLER>_PASSWORD` |

The prefixes genuinely differ per skill, so nothing could be fixed by
standardising a pattern — each repo's docs were corrected against its own code.
The code was left alone: changing a key would break every existing deployment.

`family_smoke.sh` now compares the credential variables named in each repo's docs
against the ones that repo's code builds, so the two cannot drift apart again.

## v1.8.2 (2026-07-20) — the MCP server moves into the package namespace

### Fixed — co-installing two skills broke all but the last one

Every skill shipped its MCP server as a **top-level `mcp_server` package**. Python
has one top-level namespace, so installing any two of them into one environment let
the second overwrite the first — silently, with no error and no warning.

    uv tool install vmware-aiops   ->  49 tools   (correct)
    uv pip  install vmware-aiops   ->  27 tools   (Monitor's read-only server)

vmware-aiops depends on vmware-monitor, so this was not an edge case: **every pip
install hit it**, and the operator got 27 read-only tools where 49 were expected,
with all 35 write tools missing. Docker images, shared MCP hosts and CI runners that
install more than one skill were affected the same way.

The server now lives at `vmware_<skill>/mcp_server/`, a name only this package can
claim. Introduced 2026-02-26; it survived 70 releases because every test ran against
a single package in its own repo, where the local directory shadows site-packages —
the conflict was invisible by construction.

**Migration.** Console scripts are unchanged: `vmware-<skill>` and
`vmware-<skill>-mcp` work exactly as before, as does `"command": "vmware-<skill>",
"args": ["mcp"]` in an MCP client config. Only a direct `python -m mcp_server`
breaks; use `python -m vmware_<skill>.mcp_server`.

### Added — `references/agent-guardrails.md` in every skill

The operating rules for local and small models (Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen, Mistral via
Goose / Ollama / OpenShift AI) existed in two skills. They now ship in all 13, each
with its own tool counts and failure modes, and are linked from every SKILL.md.

### Changed — Python floor is 3.10 across the family

vmware-debug and vmware-log-insight demanded 3.11 on the grounds that FastMCP schema
reflection was unreliable on 3.10. That was the symptom of PEP 604 `X | None` in the
server's own signatures, fixed in 1.8.0. 3.10 was verified end to end on 2026-07-19 —
every tool's schema built, zero failures — so the stricter floor was rejecting a
version that works.

## v1.8.1 (2026-07-19) — read-only mode reaches the surfaces that teach it

v1.8.0 put read-only mode in the code and documented it in the README only.
Every other layer was empty, and each serves a different reader: SKILL.md is what
the agent loads, setup-guide is what an operator reads while configuring, `doctor`
is where they verify it took. The gap had two concrete costs.

An agent read SKILL.md, called a write tool the gate had withheld, and got nothing
back — with no way to learn that the absence was a deliberate lockdown rather than
a fault. It reads as a broken tool, so the model retries or hunts for a workaround.

An operator who set the switch had no way to confirm it. The only signal was a line
in the MCP server's start-up log.

### Added — the feature is now documented where each reader looks

- **SKILL.md** — a short section telling the agent that a missing write tool is a
  lockdown, not a fault: name the blocked operation, do not retry, do not route
  around it.
- **references/setup-guide.md** — the operator's view: how to enable it, the
  precedence chain, and how to verify.
- **references/capabilities.md** — which tools the gate withholds.

### Added — `doctor` reports the read-only state

`vmware-log-insight doctor` now shows whether read-only mode is on, **which** of the three
switches decided it, and the value as written. A typo'd value (`ture`) is called
out as a typo rather than reported as a confident ON — it resolves to on, which is
fail-closed but almost never what was meant.

The resolution runs through `vmware_policy.read_only_status()` rather than a local
copy of the precedence chain: a doctor that disagrees with the gate it reports on is
worse than no doctor. Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.1`.

## v1.8.0 (2026-07-18) — read-only mode, working policy defaults, declared environments

Family release driven by [VMware-AIops#31](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops/issues/31),
where an operator running Llama 3.3 70B (Goose / OpenShift AI, on-prem H100) had to
hand-write 17 prompt guardrails to make tool calling reliable. A prompt is advisory — a
model can ignore it. Every guardrail that could move into the harness has.

### Added
- **Read-only mode.** Set `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` (or `VMWARE_<SKILL>_READ_ONLY`, or
  `read_only: true` in config.yaml) and every write tool is removed from the MCP registry
  at start-up. `list_tools()` never offers them, so the model cannot call what it cannot
  see. **Off by default** — nothing changes unless you turn it on. Fail-closed: if the
  mode is requested but cannot be guaranteed, the server refuses to start rather than
  running open.
- **`environment:` on each config target**, declaring which environment it is
  (production / staging / lab). Policy rules scope by this value.

### Added — list results now state whether they are complete

Every `[READ]` list tool returns the family envelope instead of a bare array:

    {"items": [...], "returned": 50, "limit": 50, "total": 213,
     "truncated": true, "hint": "Showing 50 of 213. Raise limit or narrow the query..."}

This closes the reported failure where long responses were summarised as "no data
returned": a bare list gives a model no way to tell a complete answer from page one, so
it guessed. `truncated: false` now positively states completeness — including when
`items` is empty, which means "checked, found none", not "the call failed".

- **3 tool(s) converted** across ops, MCP and CLI. Real totals at no extra cost: the appliance returns each collection in one GET and the
  limit was applied client-side, so the match count was already in memory. `alert_list`
  counts matches, respecting `name_filter`.

### Changed — migration, read this
- **Approval tiers now actually run.** They shipped in v1.6.0 but the engine only ever
  read `~/.vmware/rules.yaml`, and a fresh install has no such file — so every deny rule,
  maintenance window and approval tier had been inert on every install that never
  hand-authored one. A packaged baseline now loads when you have written no rules of your
  own. Writes at medium risk and above are stamped with their tier in the audit log;
  irreversible work and guest execution against a target declared `production` require a
  named approver via `VMWARE_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`.
- **`environment:` will become required for writes.** Today a state-changing operation
  against a target that declares none still runs and logs a warning. **The next major
  release refuses it.** Declare it now and that upgrade is a no-op:

      targets:
        prod-vc01:
          host: vc01.corp.local
          environment: production

  Read-only operations are never affected, in this release or the next. Check what applies
  to your targets before upgrading: `vmware-audit policy --operation vm_delete --env <env>`.

### Fixed
- **Policy glob patterns with a leading wildcard silently matched nothing.** A rule written
  `operations: ["*_delete"]` parsed fine, read correctly, and never fired — only a trailing
  `*` was honoured. Now full glob matching, for operations and environments alike.
- Config-path overrides (`VMWARE_<SKILL>_CONFIG`) are honoured when reading `read_only`
  and `environment`, so a setting in a custom config file is no longer silently ignored.

### Notes
- Requires `vmware-policy>=1.8.0`; publish that package first.
- `vmware-audit policy` reports which rules are in force and where they came from —
  including the case where your rules file exists but failed to parse, which previously
  looked identical to "policy is working".

## v1.6.1 (2026-06-24) — initial release

First release of **vmware-log-insight**: read-only log search and aggregation for
VMware Aria Operations for Logs (vRealize Log Insight). The centralized-log data
source for the VMware skill family.

### Added
- **7 read-only MCP tools**: `log_search` (time-window + text + filter event
  search), `log_aggregate` (COUNT/UCOUNT/AVG/… time series with z-score spike
  detection), `log_fields`, `log_version`, `alert_list`, `alert_get`,
  `alert_history`.
- **Typer CLI** mirroring the tools: `search`, `aggregate`, `fields`,
  `alert list/get/history`, `doctor`, `mcp`, `version`.
- **Session auth** (`POST /api/v2/sessions`, Bearer token, TTL refresh) with
  **centralized HTTP error translation** to teaching `LogInsightApiError`
  (status + path + fix hint); transient 502/503/504 + transport errors retry once,
  401 re-auths once, 4xx are not retried (CLAUDE.md 错误恢复三层 / 踩坑 #37).
- **Path-encoded constraint builder** with human duration shorthand ("1h", "30m",
  "7d") and URL-escaped values; never issues an unbounded query (defaults to last hour).
- **`.env` password obfuscation** built in from day one: plaintext `*_PASSWORD`
  auto-rewritten to grep-safe `b64:` via python-dotenv's own parser (obfuscation,
  not encryption; secret-manager injection documented). CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #38.
- **Spec-conformance test** (踩坑 #36): AST-scans every HTTP call against the
  official API index in `tests/eval/spec/` so a hallucinated endpoint fails CI.
- Regression evals: MCP tool exposure (踩坑 #34), read-only invariant, b64 parity.

### Notes
- Strictly **read-only** — no ingest/write tools.
- Exact v2 response schemas are parsed defensively across documented wire variants;
  confirmation against a live appliance's `/rest-api` reference is tracked in BACKLOG
  (same real-hardware-verification status as VKS `/wcp/login`).
